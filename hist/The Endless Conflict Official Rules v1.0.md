## Introduction and Purpose
The Endless Conflict aims to become a regularly held tournament, intended to be the highest tier of competition for the Crystalline Conflict game mode for Final Fantasy XIV in North America. These rules are intended to be a framework to support this goal, and are intended to support a competitive experience with a high focus on integrity and quality for the teams participating. Our goal is to cater to high-tier first and foremost and to help sustain and develop the interest in the game mode as a spectator sport in North America.

Ultimately, these rules are guiding principles in service of this goal. While the tournament will do its best to preempt and outline rules for all edge cases, tournament officials will reserve the right to make ad-hoc judgements in service of the goal of maximizing competitive integrity and the development of the scene.

We are open to any feedback, questions, or comments.

## 1. Tournament Structure
The tournament will operate on a 3 stage Groups into Double Elimination Bracket structure, with a tiebreaker stage depending on number of entries. Sets are Best of 3, with Semifinals and Finals being Best of 5. Specific implementations are subject to change.

Below is an example structure assuming 12 entries.

### 1.1. Round Robin Stage
Teams will be seeded based on tournament official discretion via methods to be determined at a later date. Teams will then be divided into 3 groups of 4, in which they will play a best of 3 against all other teams in their group.

The top 2 teams of each group advance to the tiebreaker stage.

### 1.2. Tiebreaker Stage
The top placing team in each group will compete in a round robin group of 3 for seeding, with the top placing team in this round robin being given advantageous positioning in the bracket stage.

The second placing team in each group will compete in a round robin group of 3 for seeding, with the bottom two teams being placed into the loser's bracket.

### 1.3. Bracket Stage
Teams will be placed based on performance in the tiebreaker stage into a double elimination bracket, with two of the 6 teams placed in the losers bracket. The first round of the bracket stage will be a best of 3, with semifinals and finals being best of 5s. The loser's bracket champion will need to reset the bracket against the winner's bracket champion to win the tournament.

### 1.4. Tiebreakers
In the event of tied set scores, ties will be broken in the following order:
1. Wins over tied participants
2. Total percentage scored across all games
3. Game/Set W/L Difference.


---
## 2. Game Setup
All games will be played with events and medical kits enabled. All maps are eligible for play.

### 2.1. Overview of Pre-Game Setup
Once both teams have indicated their readiness to begin a match, teams will begin map selection, then choose their composition. At this time, any team may make substitutions.

### 2.2. Map Selection
Map selection for a particular game of a set will be conducted by alternating bans per team. For example, if Team A has first ban, they are allowed to ban any of the four maps. Team B will then ban any of the remaining three maps, and so on.

The higher-ranked seed will have first ban for the first game of the set. For all games after the first, the team who lost the most recent game will have the first ban for the next game.

### 2.3. Team Composition
Following map selection, teams will submit their full composition within 1 minute to tournament officials. To prevent a situation where one team adjusts their composition based on job hovers visible in party finder, teams are not allowed to submit compositions with multiple of the same job. Once compositions are received from both teams, compositions are locked for the game.

At this time, teams may make substitutions from players in their active roster.

## 3. Player Eligibility

### 3.1. In-Game Characters
As tournament games will be held in North America, any player interested in competing in the tournament must have at least one character with their home world on a North American data center. Players are not required to have a primary character (main) on a North American data center. As of writing (2023-08-06), the North American logical data centers are Aether, Crystal, Dynamis, and Primal.

As it is a common practice for players to have multiple characters (alts) with access to different jobs, players are allowed to register and compete under any number of different characters, provided that the full list of alts is given to the tournament during registration. Any match played by a player in the tournament must be done using one of these listed characters.

### 3.2. Square Enix Disciplinary Action
For the duration of the tournament, if a player receives a ban or suspension due to in-game behavior or FFXIV Terms of Service violations on any character registered with the player, that player is not eligible to participate in the tournament until the ban or suspension is lifted. If a player receives a permanent ban, they are no longer eligible for the remainder of the tournament. This rule applies to all characters and all accounts operated by a player. Tournament officials reserve the right to include or discount account bans on a case-by-case basis.

The intent of this rule is to discourage uncompetitive behavior outside of the tournament. As the purpose of this tournament is to develop the scene at large, it is important to remember that competitors represent the community as a whole, and are expected to do their best to avoid actions that might harm the reputation of the community.

### 3.3. One Team Per Player
Players are only allowed to compete for one team during the course of the tournament. If a player decides to withdraw from the tournament or if a team decides to part ways with their team, they are not allowed to join another competing team for the duration of the season.

## 4. Team Management and Roster Rules

### 4.1. Roster Size
Teams will be required to have at least 5 and no more than 7 eligible players on its roster, with no restriction on position, rank, or designation of starter or substitute, provided that all players meet the requirements outlined in Section 1. These players are collectively referred to as the active roster.

WE HIGHLY RECOMMEND HAVING AT LEAST ONE SUBSTITUTE PLAYER ON A TEAM TO ACCOUNT FOR EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES.

### 4.2. Substitutions
Teams may freely field any five players from their active roster for the start of the match. Teams may freely substitute players from their active roster between games.

### 4.3. Roster Changes
A team may change the players on their active roster at any point during the tournament. Any new players must meet the requirements outlined in Section 3. Weekly rosters are locked one day before a team is scheduled to have a match. For example, a match played on Saturday will lock both team's rosters on Friday. Tournament officials reserve the right to approve or deny any such request, based on the eligibility of the players involved, the request's compliance with the rules, and other extenuating circumstances.

### 4.4. Team and Character Names
Teams registering for the tournament must submit a name to operate under. To avoid confusion during the broadcast, names may not contain vulgarities, obscenities, or derivatives of products, services, or game functions intended to cause confusion. Tournament officials reserve the right to approve or deny names at their discretion.

### 4.5. English Language
As the tournament will be conducted and organized in English, in the interest of efficiency, any team registering for the tournament must have at least one member be able to communicate with tournament officials in English.

### 4.5. Loss of Eligibility
Teams are responsible for being aware of any player's loss of eligibility for any reason and must take appropriate action to notify tournament officials and submit roster adjustments in a timely manner.

## 5. Tournament Procedures

### 5.1. Competition Server
Tournament matches will be played on the Dynamis logical data center, barring technical complication preventing games from being played on Dynamis.

### 5.2. Setup and Player Responsibilities for Online Matches
All players will be expected to be ready to join the party finder and play at the time specified by tournament officials.

### 5.3. Schedule Adjustments
Tournament officials reserve the right to adjust the match schedule at any time to preserve the pacing of the tournament or to remedy situations that may detract from viewer experiences.

### 5.4. Lateness Penalties and Insufficient Players
A team will automatically forfeit a set if they have 0 team members in the party finder within 5 minutes from their official match start time or the conclusion of a prior best-of game (e.g. joining for Game 2 or 3 of a best-of-three). Teams that have at least one team member in the lobby for the first game of their set will have an extra 2 minutes, for a total of 7 minutes.

Teams are required to field a full team of five players from their active roster to be considered ready to start any match. If a player disconnects from the party finder, the team is no longer ready to play and the late timer continues.

Teams that do not have a full field of five players from their active roster at the end of their late period are considered to have forfeited the set, regardless of number of games already played in the set.

Intentionally delaying the lobby or game start will still subject the team to penalties.

### 5.5. Player Equipment Responsibility
All players are responsible for ensuring the performance of their chosen setup. A problem with player equipment is not an acceptable reason for lateness beyond a team's allowance.

### 5.6. Spectators, Streaming, and Recording Matches
Spectators are permitted in the party finder only for the purposes of streaming or recording official matches. Spectators may not actively communicate with players on either team while the game is in play.

Tournament streams will have a minimum delay of 30 seconds. Players participating in matches may stream the match from their perspective with a minimum delay of 30 seconds.

Rebroadcasts, VOD reviews, and other additional content using match footage are allowed to be posted after the match is complete with no restrictions.

## 6. Game Rules

### 6.1. In-Game Disconnects
If a player disconnects at or before the first instance of damage plus 5 seconds, the game will be remade. If a player disconnects after this period, their team may choose to continue to play 4v5.

### 6.2. Game Restarts Due to Bugs
If a game experiences a critical bug at any point during the match that significantly alters gameplay mechanics, or the external environmental conditions become unstable, then a restart may occur.

In order for a restart to be granted, tournament officials must determine that the bug is critical and verifiable. For the bug to be considered critical, the bug must significantly damage a player’s ability to compete in the game situation. The determination of whether the bug has damaged a player’s ability to compete is up to the sole discretion of the tournament officials. In order for a bug to be considered verifiable, the bug must be conclusively present and not possibly attributable to player error.

If a player believes they have experienced a critical bug, they must notify tournament officials in a timely fashion. If it is believed that a player is attempting to delay reporting of a bug to wait for a possible restart at a more advantageous time, then a restart will no longer be granted.

If tournament officials determine that the bug is critical and verifiable, then the disadvantaged team will be given the option to restart the game. Tournament officials reserve the right to force a game restart in the event of a bug that compromises the core integrity of the game.

#### 6.2.1. Snapshotting
Due to how Final Fantasy XIV is programmed, actions that are theoretically intended to grant effects may fail to do so due to server latency and the order in which the core server registers events. For example, although Paladin's limit break grants immunity to damage, it is possible to kill a Paladin who has used their limit break if the damage needed to kill them registers before the player's use of the limit break registers on the server. For the purposes of this tournament, issues in snapshotting are not considered to be bugs.

### 6.3. Draw Conditions
In the extremely unlikely event of an in-game draw, the winner of a game will be determined by whichever team obtained the most kills, then by the team that did the most combined damage.

## 7. Competition Conduct and Disciplinary Actions

### 7.1. Intent of Disciplinary Action (Mission Statement)
The purpose of the tournament as a whole is to advance Crystalline Conflict as a spectator sport and develop the highest level of competition. As a result, rules are created with the acknowledgement that certain infractions are more severe than others.

While we outline specific infractions to guide our decisions on disqualification, they are not the law, **and we reserve the right to make ad-hoc decisions**. We craft these rules to help guide decisions towards whatever maximizes competitive integrity and the integrity of the tournament with the understanding that we cannot craft a set of rules that achieves this with legalistic precision.

**Once again, tournament officials will reserve the right to make ad-hoc judgements in service of the goal of maximizing competitive integrity and the development of the scene.**

### 7.2. Communication of Disciplinary Actions
In situations where tournament officials enact disciplinary actions, tournament officials will clearly communicate the specific offenses believed to have been committed, citing relevant passages if necessary.

### 7.3. Penalty Index
The following actions will be considered unfair play and are subject to game forfeiture, match forfeiture, or tournament disqualification at tournament official discretion:
